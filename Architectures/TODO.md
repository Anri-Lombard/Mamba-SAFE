- Small implementations
- Train SAFE small model on MOSES first for quick results to see successful implementation and training workflow
- Train SAFE model first on 200k zinc molecules that will be all our baseline models
- Train other large models on same 200k zinc molecules
- Train smaller models
- Set up inference experiments
- ...

Should incorporate?

- Comparison with pre-trained models for some comparison?
  - Does not make sense since these are not on molecules...
  - Fine tune them on molecules?
- ...
