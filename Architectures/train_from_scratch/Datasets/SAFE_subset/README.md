# SAFE Subset

Sequential Attachment-based Fragment Embedding (SAFE) is a novel molecular line notation that represents molecules as an unordered sequence of fragment blocks to improve molecule design using generative models.

Find the details and how to use at SAFE in the repo https://github.com/datamol-io/safe or the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.10773.pdf.

This dataset is a subset of the original dataset containing over 1B molecules, this one containing just over 300M molecules.
